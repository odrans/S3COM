{\bfseries{A satellite simulator and retrieval sandbox tool for cloud studies.}}

S3\+COM is a tool at the interface of high-\/resolution modeling and satellite observations. It aims to make cloud studies a little easier by
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Simulating realistic satellite observations and cloud products from model outputs
\item Quantifying the sensitivity of radiative quantities to cloud parameters (in progress)
\item Assisting the development of retrieval algorithms using output fields from high-\/resolution models (in progress)

S3\+COM can be installed via its makefile\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git\ clone\ https://github.com/odrans/S3COM.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd\ S3COM}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Dependencies}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
The following dependencies are required and should be adjusted in the Makefile\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://nwp-saf.eumetsat.int/site/software/rttov}{\texttt{ RTTOV}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item RTTOV v13.\+1 is the main radiative transfer code in S3\+COM. Please carefuly refer its documentation for the installation.
\item {\bfseries{Makefile path\+:}} {\ttfamily PATH\+\_\+\+RTTOV}
\item {\bfseries{Notes\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Following RTTOV recommendations, it is advised to raise the system stack size\+: {\ttfamily ulimit -\/s unlimited}.
\item Depending on the spectrum of simulated instruments, adequate \href{https://nwp-saf.eumetsat.int/site/software/rttov/download/coefficients/coefficient-download/}{\texttt{ coefficient files}} and \href{https://nwp-saf.eumetsat.int/site/software/rttov/download/\#Emissivity_BRDF_atlas_data}{\texttt{ BRDF / emissivity atlases}} should be downloaded and added to the RTTOV repository.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/}{\texttt{ Net\+CDF4}} (C and Fortran)
\begin{DoxyItemize}

All Makefile paths refer to base repositories, giving access to libraries, objects and binaries.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Environment}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
{\ttfamily PATH\+\_\+\+S3\+COM} should be set in Makefile to indicate where S3\+COM is installed.

The environment section provides advised settings on specific supercomputers.

Note\+: Run {\ttfamily make clean} to remove all built binaries, libraries and objects.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
S3\+COM requires the path to a namelist file as main argument\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./s3com\ config\_default.nml}

\end{DoxyCode}
 The namelist contains information on input and output files as well as important options to run S3\+COM. Refer to the namelist section for a detailed description.

{\bfseries{S3\+COM outputs}} are 3 files containing satellite simulations, retrievals and atmospheric data. See the output section.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Current limitations}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The current version is only configured to handle simulations from the {\bfseries{ICON}} model. Some adjustments will be necessary to use outputs from another model.
\item S3\+COM only simulates measurements from passive remote-\/sensing sensors.
\item Polarization and 3D effects are not included.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{R package}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
The \href{https://github.com/odrans/Rs3com}{\texttt{ Rs3com}} package was developed to conveniently create namelist files, run the algorithm, read its input and output and create basic figures.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Caution}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
S3\+COM does not account for sub-\/grid variability of cloud properties. It should be used on atmospheric model simulations with a spatial resolutions similar or higher than that of the selected satellite instruments, ideally from CRMs or LES models. It is advised against using S3\+COM on GCM outputs; for such use we advise more dedicated satellite simulators, such as \href{https://github.com/CFMIP/COSPv2.0}{\texttt{ COSPv2}}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}
